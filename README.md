## Docker + Saltstack + Python Flask
Pratical example on deploying servers running a Flask app and salstack. I know it goes through the wrong way of how does Docker works, but why not?
Maybe you wish to deploy stuff on running containers which you can't kill, or just run scripts on multiple containers simultaneously, I don't know. But there must be some use.
